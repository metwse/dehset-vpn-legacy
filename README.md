# DEHSeT VPN - Dynamic Encrypted High-Security Tunnel
Dehset VPN is a proprietary virtual network software designed for tunneling
license server, SSH, and RDP ports. The source code policy is subject to change
and may be open-sourced in the future.

The current version uses symetric encryption. Development of a custom TLS
protocol is currently in progress.

The scope of Dehset VPN is limited to port tunneling. It does not create a full
network or virtual network interface.
